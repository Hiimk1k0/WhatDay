# WhatDay
Type a day of the week and it will display

This is purely a test.
Only uses a switch and display the day of the week that the user inputs
If user miss spell, the program will default say that the "input" is not valid
If user inputs only downcase letters, the first will be transformed in upper case.
I will be working on changing the rest of letter to down case, in case of caps lock type.
